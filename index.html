Conclusion :
   --About
        My name is Simon Takite, Linux Foundation Certified Engineer (LFCE) with experience 
	at every layer of the technology stack from the OS to the front-end. A team player, 
	both technical and cultural, passionate and opinionated about best practices yet 
	seasoned enough to recognize when Done beats Done Right. I take advantage of my years 
	of professional experience: designing, building, and deploying complex scalable 
	systems that perform well, degrade gracefully, and fail rarely by adopting patterns 
	and processes that manage the complexity of scaling your organisation both t
	echnologically and as a team.
    
        My interests are in the field of technology, and management. I started my 
        technological path in the early 90's and have continued to today. I had been exposed 
        at an early age to people that were computer professionals and engineers and through 
        these people I have formed a foundation that I have since expanded on to become 
        whom I am.
    
        The principal takeaway is that I am not afraid of technology. I enjoy the trials of 
        learning something new and figuring out better ways to solve old problems. I don't 
        believe in "one-size fits all" regarding technology. Every situation is different 
        and the only way to be versed enough to accommodate enterprise and user needs is 
        to become knowledgeable in as many fields as possible.

   --Summary
        Most of my education has been purposed built in regards to Computing and Information
        Technologies. I have developed of my skills in business and I strive for a balance of
        technical know how, and business awareness. Being not only an Open Source enthusiast 
        In taking the best that the Open Source Community has to offer I also attempt to give 
        back to further the development and community that I feel I am part of. 
    
        Information Systems and commerce are not my only strengths. Unlike the stereotypical 
        "geek" I have strong interpersonal skills and tend to make lasting relationships 
        with people, in and outside of the workplace. Lastly I have an aptitude for learning. 
        I enjoy the challenge of something new and I look forward to those future challenges. 
        At no time to do I believe I will ever stop learning.
